# Project: Restaurant-Page
A fictional restaurant SPA built for The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on modular JavaScript, Webpack bundling, and DOM-based content rendering. The site provides dynamic, reload-free navigation and responsive layouts across key pages like Home, Menu, About, and Contact.

# Features & Implementation
